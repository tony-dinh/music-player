# Music Player

A music player created as part of a series of exercises for a course in Web Information Systems.

**NOTE:** Bootstrap 3.0 is included solely for the icons -- Any other source of icons will work. Grid/layout built using flex-box.

## Developing
Run the following command in the terminal to enable hot loading stylistic changes:
```sass --watch styles/styes.scss:client/styles.css```

Open up `client/index.html` in the browser to view the music player.
