## Getting Started

### Running

You can run this project locally or through a provisioned environment using `Vagrant`.

#### Locally

In order to compile the files to obtain distribution-ready `.css` and `.js` files, you need a few things:

1. Node 6.X.X
1. NPM 3.X.X
1. [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install)

If you are running the app for the first time and the client `.css` and `.js` files have not been built yet, you may be required to run:
```
npm install && npm run install-dep && npm run build && node populateDb.js
```

To run the app, execute the following command in your terminal at the project ROOT:
```
npm start
```

Head over to your browser and open up `localhost:3000` to view the app.

#### Provisioned Environment

In order to set up your environment, you will need:

1. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
1. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

To boot up the virtual machine, run the following at the ROOT of the project folder:
```
vagrant up
```

Head over to your browser and open up `localhost:8080` to view the app.

**NOTE:** To shut down your provisioned environment, use the following command:
```
vagrant halt
```

### Developing
